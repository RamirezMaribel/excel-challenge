In columns S & T, I would normally use the "Text to Column" function in Excel, however since the instructions wanted a formula, I Googled the "left" and "right" formulas. 
I know it exists as I've used it in my past, but didn't really remember exactly what nested formulas needed to go into it.
Here are the links of where I found the formulas I used:
